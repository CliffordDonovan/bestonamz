const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do pimple patches work?",
    answer: "Pimple patches use hydrocolloid technology to create a moist environment that draws out pus, oil, and impurities from whiteheads. They also protect the blemish from bacteria and prevent picking, which can lead to scarring."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I apply a pimple patch?",
    answer: "Apply pimple patches to clean, dry skin when you notice a whitehead forming. They work best on surface-level pimples that have come to a head. For best results, apply before bed and leave on for 6-8 hours or overnight."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I wear pimple patches during the day?",
    answer: "Yes, many pimple patches are transparent and can be worn during the day under makeup. However, they're most effective when left undisturbed, so overnight application typically yields better results."
  },
  {
    question: "Do pimple patches work on all types of acne?",
    answer: "Pimple patches work best on whiteheads and surface-level pimples. They're less effective on blackheads, cystic acne, or closed comedones. For deeper acne, consider microneedle patches like ZitSticka KILLA that can penetrate further into the skin."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any side effects to using pimple patches?",
    answer: "Pimple patches are generally safe for most skin types. Some people may experience mild irritation from the adhesive, especially with sensitive skin. If you notice redness or irritation that persists after removal, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist."
