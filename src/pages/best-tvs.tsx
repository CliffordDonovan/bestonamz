const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between OLED and QD-OLED TVs?",
    answer: "QD-OLED combines OLED's perfect blacks with Quantum Dot technology for enhanced color volume and brightness. Models like the Sony A95L offer superior color accuracy and can get brighter than traditional OLED while maintaining the infinite contrast ratio that makes OLED special."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Fire TV models worth considering?",
    answer: "Amazon Fire TV models offer excellent value, especially for Prime members. They integrate seamlessly with Alexa and the Amazon ecosystem, receive regular updates, and often have competitive pricing. However, they may lack some premium picture processing found in higher-end brands."
  },
  {
    question: "What size TV should I buy for my room?",
    answer: "For optimal viewing, sit 1.5-2.5 times the screen diagonal away from the TV. A 65\" TV works well for rooms where you sit 8-11 feet away, while 75\"+ TVs are ideal for larger spaces or if you sit further back. Consider your room layout and seating arrangement."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need HDMI 2.1 for gaming?",
    answer: "HDMI 2.1 is essential for next-gen gaming features like 4K at 120Hz, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM). If you have a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or gaming PC, look for TVs with multiple HDMI 2.1 ports for the best experience."
  },
  {
    question: "How important is HDR support?",
    answer: "HDR (High Dynamic Range) significantly improves picture quality with better contrast and more vivid colors. Look for TVs that support HDR10, Dolby Vision, and have adequate peak brightness (1000+ nits) to truly benefit from HDR content on streaming services and 4K Blu-rays."
