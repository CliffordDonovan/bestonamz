const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do pimple patches work?",
    answer: "Pimple patches use hydrocolloid technology to absorb fluid and pus from pimples while protecting them from bacteria and external irritants. They create a moist healing environment that promotes faster recovery and prevents scarring."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I use pimple patches?",
    answer: "Pimple patches work best on whiteheads or pimples that have come to a head. Apply them to clean, dry skin and leave on for 6-8 hours or overnight. They're most effective on surface-level blemishes rather than deep cystic acne."
  },
  {
    question: "Are pimple patches safe for sensitive skin?",
    answer: "Yes, most quality pimple patches are dermatologist-tested and safe for sensitive skin. Look for hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic options like COSRX or Rael Beauty that are free from harsh chemicals and fragrances."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I leave a pimple patch on?",
    answer: "Leave pimple patches on for 6-8 hours or overnight for best results. You'll know it's working when the patch turns white or opaque, indicating it has absorbed fluid from the pimple. Remove gently to avoid skin irritation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I wear makeup over pimple patches?",
    answer: "Some ultra-thin patches like Rael Beauty Miracle Patches are designed to be nearly invisible under makeup. However, for best results, it's recommended to use patches without makeup, especially overnight treatments."
