const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Can vacuum mop combos replace separate tools?",
    answer: "For most everyday cleaning, yes. Vacuum mop combos like the Tineco Floor One S5 effectively handle both vacuuming and mopping in one pass. However, you might still need a dedicated mop for heavily soiled areas or a vacuum for carpets and upholstery."
  },
  {
    question: "Are cordless vacuum mops better than corded?",
    answer: "Cordless models offer better maneuverability and convenience for quick cleanups. However, corded models like the Bissell CrossWave Pet Pro typically provide stronger suction and don't require charging, making them better for larger homes or deep cleaning sessions."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of floors work with vacuum mops?",
    answer: "Most vacuum mops work on sealed hard floors including hardwood, laminate, tile, and linoleum. Some models like the Bissell CrossWave can handle area rugs and low-pile carpets, but most are designed specifically for hard surfaces."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I clean the vacuum mop?",
    answer: "After each use, empty dirty water tanks, rinse filters, and clean brush rolls. Models with self-cleaning functions like the Tineco Floor One S5 automate much of this process, but regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and hygiene."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need special cleaning solutions?",
    answer: "While branded solutions are recommended for best results and warranty coverage, many models work with gentle floor cleaners. Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the machine or leave residue on your floors."
