const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What makes mushroom coffee different from regular coffee?",
    answer: "Mushroom coffee combines traditional coffee with functional mushrooms like Lion's Mane, Chaga, and Reishi. These adaptogenic fungi provide additional health benefits including improved focus, immune support, and reduced jitters compared to regular coffee. The result is a smoother energy boost with added wellness benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "Does mushroom coffee taste like mushrooms?",
    answer: "Most mushroom coffees are designed to taste like regular coffee with subtle earthy undertones. High-quality blends like Four Sigmatic balance the mushroom flavors well, making them barely noticeable. The coffee flavor typically dominates, especially in ground coffee varieties."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the health benefits of mushroom coffee?",
    answer: "Mushroom coffee can provide immune system support, improved cognitive function, sustained energy without crashes, and adaptogenic stress relief. Different mushrooms offer specific benefits: Lion's Mane for brain health, Chaga for immunity, and Reishi for relaxation and sleep quality."
  },
  {
    question: "How much caffeine is in mushroom coffee?",
    answer: "Mushroom coffee typically contains 50-100mg of caffeine per serving, about half the amount of regular coffee. This reduced caffeine content, combined with adaptogenic mushrooms, provides sustained energy without the typical coffee crash or jitters."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I drink mushroom coffee every day?",
    answer: "Yes, mushroom coffee is generally safe for daily consumption and is designed to be a healthier alternative to regular coffee. The adaptogenic properties of the mushrooms may actually provide cumulative benefits with consistent use. However, consult your healthcare provider if you have specific health concerns."
